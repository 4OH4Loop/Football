This challenge, from Professor Gallaugher's SwiftUI course, required students to
practice modifiying text size, weight, and color, as well as image scale and color.
Additionally, we used both vertical and horizontal orientation to arrange the text 
and images to recreate the app screen presented by Professor Gallaugher. 
This is what the app screen looks like:

<img width="233" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-20 at 10 15 34â€¯AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a82b8f4c-4c56-409b-9709-f32c05344e48" />
